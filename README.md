# sendMail
A repository for sending email using mailgun and sendgrid email

## Cloud Deployment
Heroku cloud is used to deploy the node.js REST API with Swagger UI

_NB: The GIT repository used for deployment on Heroku is hosted on Heroku_

_The reason for this is to deploy the Mailgun and Sendgrid API keys and keep it safe_

*The repository for viewing the code is hosted on Github without the Mailgun and Sendgrid keys* [https://github.com/adriaanbotha/sendMail](https://github.com/adriaanbotha/sendMail)

# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server locally, run:

```
npm run dev
```

To run tests:
```
npm run test
```


To view the Swagger UI interface:

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
